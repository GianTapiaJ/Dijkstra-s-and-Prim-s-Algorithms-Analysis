# Dijkstra-s-and-Prim-s-Algorithms-Analysis
This project compares the efficiency of these two algorithms, with graphic visualizations.

This code compares Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithms on an urban road network. It downloads Guadalajara's street data, calculates travel times, and implements both algorithms. The system visualizes optimal paths and minimum spanning trees on the map. It benchmarks performance across different network sizes, generating execution time comparisons. Results are presented in a professional table and comparative graph. The analysis highlights algorithmic efficiency for transportation applications.
